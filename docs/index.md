# About Sims CC Sorter
*This documentation is a work in progress and is not yet complete, it won't be considered complete until the first release of the application.*

Most of the code when it comes to digging into package files and extracting information has been shamelessly cannibalized from other sources, which are linked at the bottom. Because of that, I've been writing up documentation on the package files and how the code is used to stop me forgetting if I take a break. 

Feel free to use my code for your own package-related applications.

# [Package Files](#){name=packages}

DBPF files (aka package files) have versions within them, which I extracted to tell what game they're meant for. Unfortunately there's some overlap, but here's the important bits so far:

Game | Major |  Minor | Index Minor Version
Sims 2 | 1 |  1 | 1
Sims 3 | 2 |  0 | 2
Sims 4 | 2 |  1 | 2
Sims Medieval | 2 |  0 | 2
Spore | 2 |  0 | 2
SimCity 5 | 3 |  0 | 2

I'm still trying to figure out how to differentiate between Sims 3, Spore and Sims Medieval, and something I'll look into in the future.
