- Create an information file for each mod

so for example sinfulsimming_nyrahair.package and sinfulsimming_nyrahair.inf

Inf will be either a ini or an xml, and contain the information from the item! 

Save thumbs that way too? 

- add folder
- background process searches info 
- file, of course 
- author from internal name
-- database. You can add to it 
- "clear cache on launch" checkbox
- load order? 
- categories, folders, sections etc etc 
- right click for rename delete etc 
- right click "query" if auto info is off in settings 
- always check if folder contains files still


(need to get the info for new items from new packs too)
