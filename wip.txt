today:
- set up auto-moving in console (move each game type into own folder)
- swap processing to bitarray




TO IMPLEMENT:
- save to database/json as it processes, remove files from "all packages" or add to "processed". then if it crashes or the computer crashes, you can pick "continue scan"


>remove from allpackages
>add immediately to "currently processing"
>process
>add to db
>remove from "currently processing"
